# RobotArena

Welcome to RobotArena, the official codebase supporting our NeurIPS paper submission. This repository is organized into two primary components:

## 1. Robotic Policy Evaluation Framework

Located in the `benchmark_eval` folder, this framework provides a systematic approach to evaluate the performance and robustness of various robotic manipulation policies (e.g., **Octo, CogAct, SpatialVLA, and RoboVLM**) across diverse simulated scenarios.

## 2. Scene Placement in Simulation (Real2Sim)

Found within the `scene_generation` folder, this component offers an automated pipeline to reconstruct real-world robotic interaction scenes into interactive 3D environments for simulators. This facilitates the creation of realistic settings for policy development and testing.

For detailed setup, usage instructions, and further information, please refer to the specific documentation within each component's respective folder.
